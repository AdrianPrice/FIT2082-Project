# Augmented Reality Data Visualisation Controlled via Hand Movements
As the unfolding health crisis of COVID-19 continues, more and more interactions are taking place via online video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Facetime, Skype, etc.). Data visualization via these mediums is hard. Speakers either must resort to static PowerPoint slides, or purchase expensive and bulky equipment, as seen on the ABC:

Another issue is that, during online presentations, the speaker’s face often takes on a supporting role, being relegated to a small box in the corner, or in some cases, removed entirely. Studies have shown the audience’s, when shown the speakers face, are more inclined to interact with the speaker and report more enjoyment after listening (Study). As the continuance of online interactions seems likely, these problems are going to become more apparent, particularly in the fields of education and business hence new and innovative mediums of data visualization must be developed.

This project aims to solve both the problems of static, unengaging presentations that put the speaker in a supporting role by providing a low-cost, human-centric means for speakers to actively present and engage with their data through their webcam.
